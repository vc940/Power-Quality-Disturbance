It contains a Matrix (1000 x 100 x 17) | (Signals per classes x Samples per Signal x Class)
The classes are placed in the following order:
1. Pure_Sinusoidal
2. Sag
3. Swell
4. Interruption
5. Transient
6. Oscillatory_Transient
7. Harmonics
8. Harmonics_with_Sag
9. Harmonics_with_Swell
10. Flicker
11. Flicker_with_Sag
12. Flicker_with_Swell
13. Sag_with_Oscillatory_Transient
14. Swell_with_Oscillatory_Transient
15. Sag_with_Harmonics
16. Swell_with_Harmonics
17. Notch

CSV
There are 17 CSV files for each Class. Each CSV file (1000 x 100) has 1000 signals with each signal having a length of 100 samples.
